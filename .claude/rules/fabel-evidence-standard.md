# Evidence Standard — Always-On Rule (Fabel method)

> **Authority**: Always loaded. Applies to ALL outputs and ALL subagent reports
> when building this workspace (Authority-Site / Pi-CEO / Unite-Group). Adopted
> from `CleanExpo/Fabel-Prompt-Engineer` ("The Fable System"). Companion to
> `.claude/FABEL_PLAYBOOK.md` and the `fable-engine` skill. Reinforces — does not
> replace — the sandbox-first rule in `CLAUDE.md` and the `review-board` skill.

## The rule

Every factual or progress claim carries **exactly one** tag. An untagged claim
is a defect; when in doubt, downgrade.

| Tag | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `[VERIFIED]` | Backed by a checkable source: a tool result you just ran, a URL, or a file path/line in this repo you read. | Only `[VERIFIED]` material may be stated as fact or merged on. |
| `[INFERENCE]` | A reasonable conclusion from verified material. | Must name what it was inferred from. |
| `[UNCONFIRMED]` | An assumption or unsourced claim. | Must be flagged as a risk/assumption, never acted on as fact. |

## How it binds the build

- **Subagent reports.** A subagent's "build passes / tests green / type-check
  clean" is `[UNCONFIRMED]` to the orchestrator until the orchestrator re-runs
  the gauntlet (`npm run build`, `npm run type-check`, `npm test`) on the
  integrated tree. Subagents SHOULD tag their own report lines; the orchestrator
  MUST re-verify before merge. *Why: a subagent's "verified-green" is a claim
  about its own isolated context, not the integrated tree — the two diverge, and
  the divergence is exactly where breaks hide.*
- **Status / done claims.** "Deployed", "live", "passing", "no schema drift"
  require the tool output that proves it (the Vercel state, the `Tests:` line,
  `npm run check:schema-drift` output). Pair with the sandbox-first rule: schema
  / DB-writing claims are `[UNCONFIRMED]` until proven in the sandbox
  (`xgqwfwqumliuguzhshwv`) before prod (`lksfwktwtmyznckodsau`).
- **Specs.** Every `[UNCONFIRMED]` item in a `fable-engine` spec lands in the
  spec's risk/assumption register, not the body.

## Banned without a tag

"should work" · "probably passes" · "looks correct" · "all green" (as an
assertion rather than a quoted tool result) · "no drift" (without the diff) ·
any external fact (price, API shape, version) stated without its source.
